# pykafka_practice

A good bare bones example of what a kafka pipeline looks like as a containerized python pipeline.

Uses the confluence kafka broker and the python docker images. Confluence kafka python packages that are missing files and packages for it to work in a containerized enviroment.

It is seriously such a witch hunt trying to find all the commands you need to set up the the confluence kafka on a python container. Just use this repo
